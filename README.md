# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

A first try at a React Native app. In this app you can choose an animal from a picker and see a gif with that animal and then share it with a friend or choose antoher gif. 

## The problem

I used Giphy open API to fecth the gifs and the react native Share function to share the gif. If I had more time I would do a bit more styling of the app and try to divied it into more components.
